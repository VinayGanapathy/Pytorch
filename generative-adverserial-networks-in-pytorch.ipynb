Generative Adverserial Networks or GANs, however, use neural networks for a very different purpose: Generative modeling\n\n> Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. - [Source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/)\n\nWhile there are many approaches used for generative modeling, a Generative Adverserial Network takes the following approach: \n\n![GAN Flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/6NMdO9u.png)\n\nThere are two neural networks: a *Generator* and a *Discriminator*. The generator generates a \"fake\" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is \"real\" (picked from the training data) or \"fake\" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs. This rather simple approach can lead to some astounding results. The following images ([source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/resources-for-getting-started-with-generative-adversarial-networks/)), for instances, were all generated using GANs:\n\n<img src=\"https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Example-of-Photorealistic-Human-Faces-Generated-by-a-GAN.png\" alt=\"gans_results\" width=\"480\">\n\n\nGANs however, can be notoriously difficult to train, and are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, activation functions and regularization. In this tutorial, we'll train a GAN to generate images of handwritten digits similar to those from the MNIST database.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CAYnuo1.jpg\" width=\"360\" >\n\nMost of the code for this tutorial has been borrowed for this excellent repository of PyTorch tutorials: [github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial).

This is where we employ a rather elegant trick, which is to use the discriminator as a part of the loss function. Here's how it works:\n\n- We generate a batch of images using the generator, pass the into the discriminator.\n\n- We calculate the loss by setting the target labels to 1 i.e. real. We do this because the generator's objective is to \"fool\" the discriminator. \n\n- We use the loss to perform gradient descent i.e. change the weights of the generator, so it gets better at generating real-like images.\n\nHere's what this looks like in code.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"g_optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(G.parameters(), lr=0.0002)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-10T15:05:11.442772Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-10T15:05:11.443027Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-10T15:05:11.447291Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-10T15:05:11.442996Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-10T15:05:11.446180Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def train_generator():\n    # Generate fake images and calculate loss\n    z = torch.randn(batch_size, latent_size).to(device)\n    fake_images = G(z)\n    labels = torch.ones(batch_size, 1).to(device)\n    g_loss = criterion(D(fake_images), labels)\n\n    # Backprop and optimize\n    reset_grad()\n    g_loss.backward()\n    g_optimizer.step()\n    return g_loss, fake_images","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-10T15:05:29.246360Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-10T15:05:29.247138Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-10T15:05:29.253060Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-10T15:05:29.247084Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-10T15:05:29.252129Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Training the Model\n\nLet's create a directory where we can save intermediate outputs from the generator to visually inspect the progress of the model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\n\nsample_dir = 'samples'\nif not os.path.exists(sample_dir):\n    os.makedirs(sample_dir)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-10T15:05:33.376089Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-10T15:05:33.376653Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-10T15:05:33.380890Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-10T15:05:33.376614Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-10T15:05:33.379918Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's save a batch of real images that we can use for visual comparision while looking at the generated images.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Image\nfrom torchvision.utils import save_image\n\n# Save some real images\nfor images, _ in data_loader:\n    images = images.reshape(images.size(0), 1, 28, 28)\n    save_image(denorm(images), os.path.join(sample_dir, 'real_images.png'), nrow=10)\n    break\n   \nImage(os.path.join(sample_dir, 'real_images.png'))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-10T15:05:37.832767Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-10T15:05:37.833379Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-10T15:05:37.880713Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-10T15:05:37.833337Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-10T15:05:37.879974Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll also define a helper function to save a batch of generated images to disk at the end of every epoch.
