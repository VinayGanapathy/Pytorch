[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select \"Run on Binder\" or \"Run on Kaggle\" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab. \n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python.

In addition to the `ToTensor` transform, we'll also apply some other transforms to the images. There are a few important changes we'll make while creating PyTorch datasets for training and validation:\n\n1. **Use test set for validation**: Instead of setting aside a fraction (e.g. 10%) of the data from the training set for validation, we'll simply use the test set as our validation set. This just gives a little more data to train with. In general, once you have picked the best model architecture & hypeparameters using a fixed validation set, it is a good idea to retrain the same model on the entire dataset just to give it a small final boost in performance.\n2. **Channel-wise data normalization**: We will normalize the image tensors by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation across each channel. As a result, the mean of the data across each channel is 0, and standard deviation is 1. Normalizing the data prevents the values from any one channel from disproportionately affecting the losses and gradients while training, simply by having a higher or wider range of values that others.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LYxXBVg.png\" width=\"360\">\n\n\n3. **Randomized data augmentations**: We will apply randomly chosen transformations while loading images from the training dataset. Specifically, we will pad each image by 4 pixels, and then take a random crop of size 32 x 32 pixels, and then flip the image horizontally with a 50% probability. Since the transformation will be applied randomly and dynamically each time a particular image is loaded, the model sees slightly different images in each epoch of training, which allows it generalize better.\n\n![data-augmentation](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/cropandpad_percent.jpg)","metadata":{"id":"q0e9CopR7yJU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Data transforms (normalization & data augmentation)\nstats = ((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010))\ntrain_tfms = tt.Compose([tt.RandomCrop(32, padding=4, padding_mode='reflect'), \n                         tt.RandomHorizontalFlip(), \n                         # tt.RandomRotate\n                         # tt.RandomResizedCrop(256, scale=(0.5,0.9), ratio=(1, 1)), \n                         # tt.ColorJitter(brightness=0.1, contrast=0.1, saturation=0.1, hue=0.1),\n                         tt.ToTensor(), \n                         tt.Normalize(*stats,inplace=True)])\nvalid_tfms = tt.Compose([tt.ToTensor(), tt.Normalize(*stats)])","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":24417,"status":"ok","timestamp":1608382652491,"user":{"displayName":"Aakash N S","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiIWFHtan62vtW1gz2Bv2bxL3rppefcadxzEVxRKQ=s64","userId":"03254185060287524023"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"TVz0gcdX3KUZ","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-10T14:24:10.025982Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-10T14:24:10.026237Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-10T14:24:10.034722Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-10T14:24:10.026208Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-10T14:24:10.033782Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# PyTorch datasets\ntrain_ds = ImageFolder(data_dir+'/train', train_tfms)\nvalid_ds = ImageFolder(data_dir+'/test', valid_tfms)","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":24416,"status":"ok","timestamp":1608382652492,"user":{"displayName":"Aakash N S","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiIWFHtan62vtW1gz2Bv2bxL3rppefcadxzEVxRKQ=s64","userId":"03254185060287524023"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"Rnb8LqXT3KUZ","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-10T14:24:14.688713Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-10T14:24:14.689056Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-10T14:24:15.144790Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-10T14:24:14.689013Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-10T14:24:15.144056Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, we can create data loaders for retrieving images in batches.

There are many strategies for varying the learning rate during training, and the one we'll use is called the **\"One Cycle Learning Rate Policy\"**, which involves starting with a low learning rate, gradually increasing it batch-by-batch to a high learning rate for about 30% of epochs, then gradually decreasing it to a very low value for the remaining epochs. Learn more: https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html\n\n* **Weight decay**: We also use weight decay, which is yet another regularization technique which prevents the weights from becoming too large by adding an additional term to the loss function.Learn more: https://towardsdatascience.com/this-thing-called-weight-decay-a7cd4bcfccab\n\n* **Gradient clipping**: Apart from the layer weights and outputs, it also helpful to limit the values of gradients to a small range to prevent undesirable changes in parameters due to large gradient values. This simple yet effective technique is called gradient clipping. Learn more: https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-gradient-clipping-b8e815cdfb48\n\n\nLet's define a `fit_one_cycle` function to incorporate these changes.

Try working on a project on your own by following these guidelines: https://jovian.ai/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-zero-to-gans/assignment/course-project\n\nHere's a summary of the different techniques used in this tutorial to improve our model performance and reduce the training time:\n\n\n* **Data normalization**: We normalized the image tensors by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of pixels across each channel. Normalizing the data prevents the pixel values from any one channel from disproportionately affecting the losses and gradients. [Learn more](https://medium.com/@ml_kid/what-is-transform-and-transform-normalize-lesson-4-neural-networks-in-pytorch-ca97842336bd)\n\n* **Data augmentation**: We applied random transformations while loading images from the training dataset. Specifically, we will pad each image by 4 pixels, and then take a random crop of size 32 x 32 pixels, and then flip the image horizontally with a 50% probability.

We used the ResNet9 architecture [Learn more](https://towardsdatascience.com/residual-blocks-building-blocks-of-resnet-fd90ca15d6ec).\n\n* **Batch normalization**: After each convolutional layer, we added a batch normalization layer, which normalizes the outputs of the previous layer. This is somewhat similar to data normalization, except it's applied to the outputs of a layer, and the mean and standard deviation are learned parameters.

There are [many strategies](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate) for varying the learning rate during training, and we used the \"One Cycle Learning Rate Policy\". [Learn more](https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html)\n\n* **Weight Decay**: We added weight decay to the optimizer, yet another regularization technique which prevents the weights from becoming too large by adding an additional term to the loss function. [Learn more](https://towardsdatascience.com/this-thing-called-weight-decay-a7cd4bcfccab)\n\n* **Gradient clipping**: We also added gradient clippint, which helps limit the values of gradients to a small range to prevent undesirable changes in model parameters due to large gradient values during training.  [Learn more.](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-gradient-clipping-b8e815cdfb48#63e0)\n\n* **Adam optimizer**: Instead of SGD (stochastic gradient descent), we used the Adam optimizer which uses techniques like momentum and adaptive learning rates for faster training. There are many other optimizers to choose froma and experiment with. [Learn more.](https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html)\n\n\nAs an exercise, you should try applying each technique independently and see how much each one affects the performance and training time. As you try different experiments, you will start to cultivate the intuition for picking the right architectures, data augmentation & regularization techniques.\n\nYou are now ready to move on to the next tutorial in this series: [Generating Images using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/06b-anime-dcgan/)\n","metadata":{"id":"VHrDEGvp3KUm"}}]}
