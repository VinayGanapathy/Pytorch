You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n\n#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Colab**. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select \"Run on Binder\" or \"Run on Kaggle\" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab. \n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.","metadata":{"id":"8FTYKRrdK9qJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Using a GPU for faster training\n\nYou can use a [Graphics Processing Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) (GPU) to train your models faster if your execution platform is connected to a GPU manufactured by NVIDIA. Follow these instructions to use a GPU on the platform of your choice:\n\n* _Google Colab_: Use the menu option \"Runtime > Change Runtime Type\" and select \"GPU\" from the \"Hardware Accelerator\" dropdown.\n* _Kaggle_: In the \"Settings\" section of the sidebar, select \"GPU\" from the \"Accelerator\" dropdown. Use the button on the top-right to open the sidebar.\n* _Binder_: Notebooks running on Binder cannot use a GPU, as the machines powering Binder aren't connected to any GPUs.\n* _Linux_: If your laptop/desktop has an NVIDIA GPU (graphics card), make sure you have installed the [NVIDIA CUDA drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html).\n* _Windows_: If your laptop/desktop has an NVIDIA GPU (graphics card), make sure you have installed the [NVIDIA CUDA drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html).\n* _macOS_: macOS is not compatible with NVIDIA GPUs\n\n\nIf you do not have access to a GPU or aren't sure what it is, don't worry, you can execute all the code in this tutorial just fine without a GPU.","metadata":{"id":"HP67kosYLAlQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploring the CIFAR10 Dataset\n\nIn the [previous tutorial](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/04-feedforward-nn), we trained a feedfoward neural networks with a single hidden layer to classify handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) with over 97% accuracy.

Jovian.ml solves this by capturing everyting related to a data science project on a single platform, while providing a seamless workflow for capturing, sharing and reproducting your work.

Here's quick recap of the topics:\n* Introduction to the CIFAR10 dataset for image classification\n* Downloading, extracing and loading an image dataset using `torchvision`\n* Show random batches of images in a grid using `torchvision.utils.make_grid`\n* Creating a convolutional neural network using with `nn.Conv2d` and `nn.MaxPool2d` layers\n* Capturing dataset information, metrics and hyperparameters using the `jovian` library\n* Training a convolutional neural network and visualizing the losses and errors\n* Understanding overfitting and the strategies for avoiding it (more on this later)\n* Generating predictions on single images from the test set\n* Saving and loading the model weights, and attaching them to the eperiment snaptshot using `jovian`\n\nThere's a lot of scope to experiment here, and I encourage you to use the interactive nature of Jupyter to play around with the various parameters. Here are a few ideas:\n* Try chaging the hyperparameters to achieve a higher accuracy within fewer epochs. You use the comparison table on the Jovian.ml project page to compare your experiments.\n* Try adding more convolutional layers, or increasing the number of channels in each convolutional layer\n* Try using a feedforward neural network and see what's the maximum accuracy you can achieve\n* Read about some of the startegies mentioned above for reducing overfitting and achieving better results, and try to implement them by looking into the PyTorch docs.\n* Modify this notebook to train a model for a different dataset (e.g. CIFAR100 or ImageNet)\n\nIn the next tutorial, we will continue to improve our model's accuracy using techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization and dropout. We will also learn about residual networks (or ResNets), a small but critical change to the model architecture that will significantly boost the performance of our model.
